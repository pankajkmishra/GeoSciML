Welcome to "Geoscientific Machine Learning & AI with Julia", a comprehensive guide that introduces machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques for geoscientific applications using the Julia programming language.

Julia combines the ease of use of high-level languages like Python and R with the performance of low-level languages like C and Fortran, making it ideal for scientific computing, data analysis, and machine learning in geosciences.

## What You'll Learn

This book covers:
- **Julia Fundamentals**: Core programming concepts and syntax
- **Arrays & Visualization**: Data manipulation and plotting techniques
- **Machine Learning Applications**: Practical ML/AI solutions for geoscientific problems

## Getting Started

Each chapter contains executable Julia code that you can run interactively. The book is designed to be both educational and practical, providing real-world examples relevant to geosciences.

This website is also available as [**PDF**](/geosciml.pdf){target="_blank"}.

## About the Author

**Pankaj K. Mishra** is a researcher at the Geological Survey of Finland with expertise in geoscientific machine learning and Julia programming.
